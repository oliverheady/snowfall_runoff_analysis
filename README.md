# Snowfall and Stream Runoff Analysis: Demonstrating Regression Modeling Proficiency

## Overview
This repository provides a deep dive into linear regression modeling, using a dataset capturing snowfall and stream runoff metrics. It is an embodiment of technical expertise in statistical analysis, data visualization, and Python programming.

## Technical Highlights
- **Data Wrangling**: Leveraged `pandas` for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, ensuring reliable inputs for model building.
- **Data Visualization**: Employed `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create meaningful and interpretable visualizations, highlighting trends and potential outliers.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Utilized `statsmodels` to fit, evaluate, and interpret a linear regression model, ensuring the data's story is accurately represented.
- **Diagnostics & Testing**: Conducted thorough regression diagnostics, ensuring model validity by checking assumptions of linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Built prediction capabilities, offering both point estimates and interval predictions, aiding in decision-making under uncertainty.

## Key Findings
- Found a robust positive correlation between snowfall and stream runoff, backed by statistical significance tests.
- Derived actionable insights on expected stream runoff volumes for varying snowfall levels, supported by confidence and prediction intervals.

## Files in the Repository
- `snowfall_runoff_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing each step of the analysis, from data ingestion to interpretative findings.
- `water.txt`: Source dataset driving the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the Python environment has packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, and sklearn.
3. Navigate to the Jupyter notebook (`snowfall_runoff_analysis.ipynb`) to explore the analysis end-to-end.

## Future Work & Enhancements
- Exploration of additional predictors, like temperature or sunlight levels, to refine the model further.
- Assessment of non-linear relationships or interaction terms for improved predictive accuracy.
